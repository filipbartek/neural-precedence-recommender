State-of-the-art superposition-based theorem provers for first-order logic rely on simplification orderings on terms to constrain the applicability of inference rules, which in turn shapes the ensuing search space. The popular Knuth-Bendix simplification ordering is parameterized by symbol precedence—a permutation of the predicate and function symbols of the input problem’s signature. Thus, the choice of precedence has an indirect yet often substantial impact on the amount of work required to complete a proof search.
This paper describes and evaluates a symbol precedence recommender, a machine learning system that estimates the best possible precedence based on prover performance observations on a set of problems and random precedences. Using the graph convolutional neural network technology, the system does not presuppose the problems to be related or share a common signature. When coupled with the theorem prover Vampire and evaluated on the TPTP problem library, the recommender is found to outperform a state-of-the-art heuristic by more than 2 %.
