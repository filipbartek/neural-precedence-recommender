Choosing the next inference to apply is arguably the most important decision point in the state-of-the-art

\glspl{atp} for \gls{fol}.
Since the most popular \glspl{atp} use the superposition calculus with literal selection \cite{},
the \gls{sot}, such as the \gls{kbo} \cite{Knuth1983},
plays an important role in restricting the inferences and thus guiding the proof search.
The \gls{kbo} is typically specified by a symbol precedence,
that is a permutation of non-logical symbols of the input problem.
Each of the commonly used precedence heuristics orders the symbols
lexicographically according to a small number of simple

Given that each of the heuristics used in practice, up to our knowledge, fails on some problems,
\todo{Mention that we tried already to find a good simple heuristic by ML.}
the general task of
finding a symbol precedence that guides the proof search efficiently on an arbitrary problem
remains to be intriguing.
This paper explores the possibility of tackling this task by training a neural network
on the results of running the \gls{atp} Vampire \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_1} with randomly sampled precedences.

\todo[author=Filip,inline]{Consider an alternative approach: Start with an example problem, rewrite in two ways, describe how do state-of-the-art provers differentiate between these two ways (by symbol precedence), ...}

\todo[inline,author=FB]{Try to use the first page for something more flashy than exposure of saturation-based automated proving. Ideas: catchy puzzle-like example, abstract description of the crucial challenge etc.}

Modern \gls{fol} \glspl{atp}, such as Vampire, E or SPASS,
solve \gls{fol} problems by iteratively applying the inference rules of superposition calculus.
Literal selection and equation orienting are employed to limit the ... while preserving the refutation completeness.
Both literal selection and equation orienting are determined by \gls{sot}.

A \gls{fol} problem consists of \gls{fol} formulas divided into two categories:
one or more premises and one conjecture.
% We assume that \gls{fol} is expanded to FOL.
% For this reason the article is "an".
When presented with a \gls{fol} problem,
a \definiendum{saturation-based} \gls{atp} negates the conjecture (as a first step of proof by contradiction)
and converts all the formulas into an equisatisfiable set of clauses in \gls{cnf}.
\todo[author=Filip]{Are there any saturation-based ATPs that don't use CNF?}
The prover proceeds to iteratively infer new provable clauses
until a contradiction, represented by the empty clause, is inferred,
or until no new clauses can be inferred.
A proof of the fact that the premises and the negated conjecture entail a contradiction
constitutes a proof that the premises entail the conjecture.

The state-of-the-art \gls{fol} \glspl{atp},
such as \vampire{} \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_1} and E \cite{10.1007/978-3-030-29436-6_29},
are saturation-based and
infer new provable clauses by applying the rules of the \definiendum{superposition calculus}.
\todo[author=Filip]{Cite some source that explains superposition calculus.}
The inferences under superposition calculus are constrained by a \definiendum{simplification ordering on the terms}.
\todo[author=Filip]{Do we mean terms in sensu stricto (applications of functions), or generalized terms (applications of functions and predicates)?}
The two classes of simplification orderings commonly used in practice are
\gls{lpo} \cite{Kamin1980} and \gls{kbo} \cite{Knuth1983}.
In both classes the ordering is specified by a \definiendum{symbol precedence},
\todo[author=Filip]{This may be an oversimplification: KBO is further parameterized by symbol weights.}
which is a permutation of predicate and function symbols of the input problem.

The typical approach to constructing a symbol precedence orders the symbols by a property
that is relatively cheap and straightforward to compute,
such as the frequency (the number of occurrences in the input problem) \cite{E-manual} or the arity.
\todo[author=Filip]{Cite the original source of the arity heuristic.}
The structure of the problem contains much information that is relevant for the choice of symbol precedence,
but is completely ignored by the symbol properties that inform the symbol precedences.
\todo[author=Filip]{Why do we believe this?}

This paper describes the architecture (\cref{sec:architecture}) and an empirical evaluation (\cref{sec:evaluation})
of a symbol precedence heuristic based on a \gls{gcn} \cite{kipf2017semisupervised}
and trained on proof attempts with random symbol precedences.
The experiments presented in \cref{sec:evaluation} demonstrate an improvement of success rate by 20 \%
compared to the state-of-the-art heuristic.

\iffalse % AWR draft

The performance of the state-of-the-art \acrfullpl{atp} is severely limited by some of the design decisions that constitute the provers' architecture.
For example, the \frequency{} symbol precedence heuristic of the \acrfull{fol} \acrshort{atp} \vampire{} is easily outperformed by the best of 10 random precedences.\cite{}
The gap in performance suggests that a more elaborate precedence heuristic with a superior performance exists.
% what is precedence heuristic?
% Thesis statement
Training a model from proof attempts with random precedences yields a heuristic that significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic.
