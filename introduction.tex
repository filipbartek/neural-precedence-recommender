A \gls{fol} problem consists of \gls{fol} formulas divided into two categories:
one or more premises and one conjecture.
% We assume that \gls{fol} is expanded to FOL.
% For this reason the article is "an".
When presented with a \gls{fol} problem,
a \definiendum{saturation-based} \gls{atp} negates the conjecture (as a first step of proof by contradiction)
and converts all the formulas into an equisatisfiable set of clauses in \gls{cnf}.
\todo[author=Filip]{Are there any saturation-based ATPs that don't use CNF?}
The prover proceeds to iteratively infer new provable clauses
until a contradiction, represented by the empty clause, is inferred,
or until no new clauses can be inferred.
A proof of the fact that the premises and the negated conjecture entail a contradiction
constitutes a proof that the premises entail the conjecture.

The state-of-the-art \gls{fol} \glspl{atp},
such as \vampire{} \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_1} and E \cite{10.1007/978-3-030-29436-6_29},
are saturation-based and
infer new provable clauses by applying the rules of the \definiendum{superposition calculus}.
\todo[author=Filip]{Cite some source that explains superposition calculus.}
The inferences under superposition calculus are constrained by a \definiendum{simplification ordering on the terms}.
\todo[author=Filip]{Do we mean terms in sensu stricto (applications of functions), or generalized terms (applications of functions and predicates)?}
The two classes of simplification orderings commonly used in practice are
\gls{lpo} \cite{Kamin1980} and \gls{kbo} \cite{Knuth1983}.
In both classes the ordering is specified by a \definiendum{symbol precedence},
\todo[author=Filip]{This may be an oversimplification: KBO is further parameterized by symbol weights.}
which is a permutation of predicate and function symbols of the input problem.

The typical approach to constructing a symbol precedence orders the symbols by a property
that is relatively cheap and straightforward to compute,
such as the frequency (the number of occurrences in the input problem) \cite{E-manual} or the arity.
\todo[author=Filip]{Cite the original source of the arity heuristic.}
The structure of the problem contains much information that is relevant for the choice of symbol precedence,
but is completely ignored by the symbol properties that inform the symbol precedences.
\todo[author=Filip]{Why do we believe this?}
\todo[author=Martin]{Klicovou vetu ... by asi chtelo rozvest treba do celeho odstavce. Takhle vyzni dost krypticky a neni moc jasne, co se snazi vyjadrit: "The structure of the problem" neni predem vysvetleno.

This paper describes the architecture (\cref{sec:architecture}) and an empirical evaluation (\cref{sec:evaluation})
of a symbol precedence heuristic based on a \gls{gcn} \cite{kipf2017semisupervised}
and trained on proof attempts with random symbol precedences.
The experiments presented in \cref{sec:evaluation} demonstrate an improvement of success rate by 20 \%
compared to the state-of-the-art heuristic.

The performance of the state-of-the-art \acrfullpl{atp} is severely limited by some of the design decisions that constitute the provers' architecture.
For example, the \frequency{} symbol precedence heuristic of the \acrfull{fol} \acrshort{atp} \vampire{} is easily outperformed by the best of 10 random precedences.\cite{}
The gap in performance suggests that a more elaborate precedence heuristic with a superior performance exists.
% what is precedence heuristic?
% Thesis statement
Training a model from proof attempts with random precedences yields a heuristic that significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic.
