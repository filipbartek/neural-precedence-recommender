We describe the basic logical and software architecture of the system, as well as core features of the implementation. We particularly discuss recently added features and extensions, including the extension to many-sorted logic, optional limited support for higher-order logic, and the integration of SAT techniques via PicoSAT. Minor additions include improved support for TPTP standard features, always-on internal proof objects, and lazy orphan removal. The paper also gives an overview of the performance of the system, and describes ongoing and future work.",

Although the general word problem is well known to be unsolvable, this algorithm provides results in many interesting cases. For example in elementary group theory if we are given the binary operator {\textperiodcentered}, the unary operator −, and the nullary operator e, the algorithm is capable of deducing from the three identities a {\textperiodcentered} (b {\textperiodcentered} c) = (a {\textperiodcentered} b) {\textperiodcentered} c, a {\textperiodcentered} a− = e, a {\textperiodcentered} e = a, the laws a− {\textperiodcentered} a = e, e {\textperiodcentered} a = a, a− −= a, etc.; and furthermore it can show that a {\textperiodcentered} b = b {\textperiodcentered} a−is not a consequence of the given axioms.",

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the recently introduced transfinite Knuth-Bendix orders. We prove that any such order with finite subterm coefficients and for a finite signature is equivalent to an order using ordinals below $\omega$$\omega$, that is, finite sequences of natural numbers of a fixed length. We show that this result does not hold when subterm coefficients are infinite. However, we prove that in this general case ordinals below $\omega$$\omega$$\omega$ suffice. We also prove that both upper bounds are tight. We briefly discuss the significance of our results for the implementation of first-order theorem provers and describe relationships between the transfinite Knuth-Bendix orders and existing implementations of extensions of the Knuth-Bendix orders. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

@article{Kingma2014,
   abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},
