This paper describes and evaluates a symbol precedence heuristic based on a \acrlong{gcn}.
When trained on proof attempts with random symbol precedences,
the heuristic outperforms the state of the art by more than 20~\%.
For the purpose of the evaluation, the symbol precedences predicted by the heuristic
are used to instantiate Knuth-Bendix term simplification orderings.
These orderings in turn guide the proof search in the state-of-the-art \acrlong{atp} \vampire{}
by constraining the superposition calculus inferences.
The evaluation is performed on \acrlong{fol} problems from the TPTP problem library.

% Motivation and purpose of the study are excluded because the audience at CADE need not be reminded of the motivation for making the provers faster.
