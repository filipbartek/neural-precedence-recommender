----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
  Detailed comments:

  - p16: The paper is technically over length, but only by the
    acknowledgements section (and would have the same number of total
    pages without it).
    FB: Let's shorten the paper so that even the acknowledgements fit within the limit.
    The email from the organizers says that the limit is strict,
    and that it excludes references (so I assume it includes everything else).

    MS: In my other paper, I will risk Acknowledgements on the 16th page. Let's see if they will notice :)
