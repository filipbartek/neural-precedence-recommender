----------------------- REVIEW 2 ---------------------

  Minor comments
  --------------

 - p16-17: The titles of some articles (mostly the arXiv ones, book titles are a different matter) are capitalized, while the others are not. This could be made uniform.
   FB: Let's clean up the bibliography.

   MS: Tohle cele jeste jednou prekope Springer, takze bych tim neztracel moc casu... (Staci, ze pomocnicci v Indii poznaji, ktery clanek jsme meli na mysli.)
   FB: Ok, bibliografii nebudu skoro vubec uklizet, jenom prekontroluju, ze se daji ty zdroje jasne identifikovat.

----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
  Detailed comments:

  - p16: The paper is technically over length, but only by the
    acknowledgements section (and would have the same number of total
    pages without it).
    FB: Let's shorten the paper so that even the acknowledgements fit within the limit.
    The email from the organizers says that the limit is strict,
    and that it excludes references (so I assume it includes everything else).

    MS: In my other paper, I will risk Acknowledgements on the 16th page. Let's see if they will notice :)
