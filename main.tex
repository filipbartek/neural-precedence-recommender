MS: my sami (PAAR paper) jsem si related workem. Budem se vuci tomu muset vymezit.
Jinak me ale nic moc bezprostredniho nenepada a nevim tedy, jestli se tedy primo
nutit do sekce s timto nazvem!

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Future work}

Generalization from trail acc to val acc may be improved.

Highest val accuracy does not transfer to highest ATP success rate. Generalization to ATP is sub-par.

Larger graphs

Joint model (trained jointly on predicate and function precedences)

Differentiate questions due to satiterations from questions due to success and failure

MS: Is there a knowledge transfer possible between related setups when we in vampire change
options (seemingly?) orthogonal to precedence (saturation algorithm, additional inference rules / reductions, AVATAR on/off,
clause selection strategies, etc.)?

KBO is a also parametrized by weights (along with the precedence). Could we learn those as well? (Jointly?)

Reinforcement learning will allow using a trained recommender to generate data from harder problems.

In our experiments, too much attention is spent on uninteresting examples.
We learn to order pairs of non-optimal precedences.
However, if the recommender ordered a non-optimal pair wrong, it could still produce the optimum precedence correctly.
Besides, we train from pairs of successful runs that only differ in number of iterations.

\todo[inline]{Idea for next project: Optimize precedence directly in a RL fashion: Generate precedence and evaluate with Vampire. If it is the best precedence seen so far, loss is 0 and gradient is 0. Otherwise ground truth is the best precedence seen so far on this problem and we use "differentiable ranking" to backpropagate. Possibly with some exploration, e.g. random swaps of pairs of symbols.}

Thorough analysis of the model: how does it work? how does it generalize?
